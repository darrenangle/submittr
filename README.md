Submittr
============

Submittr is an open-source submissions manager for literary magazines. 

It's designed to be a free alternative to submission manager software like Submittable and Submissions Manager targeted at younger magazines looking to cut costs.  


Tech
-----
Submittr currently uses jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap for the front-end and Parse's JavaScript SDK for the back-end.

Parse back end helps to ensure the free cost, as developers are only charged for API requests beyond 1 million per month. File size and upload limitations should keep submitter uploads from breaching the 1GB/month.
