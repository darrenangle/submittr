Submittr
============

Submittr is an open-source submissions manager for literary magazines. 

It's designed to be a free alternative to submission manager software like Submittable and Submissions Manager targeted at younger magazines looking to cut costs.  


Tech
-----
Submittr currently uses Backbone/Parse's JavaScript SDK, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap for the front-end and Parse's cloud storage for the back-end.

Parse's back end helps to ensure the free/low cost, as developers are only charged for API requests beyond 1 million per month. This should be more than enough for a smaller literary magazine. File size and upload limitations should keep Submittr uploads from breaching the 1GB/month limit.
